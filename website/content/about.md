![Marty And Pop-Pop](/poppop//images/marty-pop-pop.jpeg)

This is Pop-Pop and I using a WW2 surplus radio in the basement.  It was around this time and a few years later that he wrote the code discussed on this site.

All of the PDFs, code and the source for this website can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/mschoch/poppop).

To contact me about this series, email [marty dot schoch at gmail dot com].
