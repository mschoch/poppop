I don't have a lot of time this weekend, but it's important to keep some momentum.  So I'm going to do a bit more scanning.  This next section I've named "rubiks notes" as it seems to be personal notes about the rubik's cube, various properties, transformations, etc.

[Part 1 of the PDF can be found here](https://github.com/mschoch/poppop/blob/master/pdfs/rubiksnotes/rubiksnotes1.pdf).
[Part 2 of the PDF can be found here](https://github.com/mschoch/poppop/blob/master/pdfs/rubiksnotes/rubiksnotes2.pdf).

Some thoughts while scanning:

- The documentation of subprograms looks like it will be really useful
- There is reference to a book: [Recreations in Mathematics - Rubik's Cube Compendium](http://www.amazon.com/Rubiks-Cubic-Compendium-Recreations-Mathematics/dp/0198532024)
- Also an interesting note that "the moves shown in the following pages were NOT used in the RUBIK.BAS program"
- The diagrams and notation appear simultaneously excellent and daunting
- Likewise the transformation table seems great, then the note "apply the table in reverse order"... what???


That's all for this week.  The next section I'm not entirely sure what to do with.  It seems to be a printout of a book (copyright someone else), but with hand-drawn notes and diagrams in what appear (to me) to be my Pop-Pop's hand-writing.  So I have to do a little more digging to figure out who did what.
