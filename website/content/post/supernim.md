I'm going to start by going through the binder, basically in order, and scan the contents into PDFs.

The first section is grouped separately from the rest.  It is in a plastic sleeve and also held together with paper clips.

![SuperNim](/images/supernim/supernim.jpg)

It is an implementation of the puzzle game SuperNim (one of the many variations on [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)).  His notes reference PCM Magazine March 1990.  I did a little bit of digging on this, enough to learn that PCM Magazine was a publication devoted to Tandy PC compatibles at the time (and not a typo referring to PC Magazine as I first thought).  I was not able to find this particular back issue though.  If anyone has leads on this let me know...

It's not entirely clear if that was the entire source of this program (yes people did manually key in code they got out of a magazine back in the day).  Or if possibly he extended or augmented it in some way.

The [full scanned PDF can be found here](https://github.com/mschoch/poppop/blob/master/website/static/images/supernim/supernim.pdf).

While scanning these pages I made a few notes of my thoughts:

- The hole-punched holes ate up some text, fortunately so far they're confined to line numbers which are easily deducible
- The code has indentation around the loop structures (I don't recall doing this myself when wrote BASIC)
- Which led to me wondering, how did he edit code? (I remember both line based editing of Applesoft BASIC and full-screen QBasic, but I'm not sure how it worked for him.)
- In the code I see references to both *color* and *sound* neither of which I remembered.
