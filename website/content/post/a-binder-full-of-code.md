I've been thinking about this for a while.  I have this binder...

![Binder Closed](/images/binder-closed.jpg)

And, it's full of code...

![Binder Open](/images/binder-open.jpg)

More specifically, all of the surviving code that my Pop-Pop wrote in the late 80s and early 90s.  I've never really sat down to go through it carefully, but I know it contains at least one program to help solve a [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube).  I have reason to believe this works, or mostly works as I remember Pop-Pop talking about it and demonstrating how it worked.  I also believe he started on a program to solve the [Rubik's Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Revenge), but I'm less certain this was finished or working.

The code itself is all in BASIC, and I know that it ran on some sort of Tandy.  Finding out more details about that will have to be part of the research as I go.

So today I've finally decided to move this forward from idea to project.

### The Plan

- Set up a git repo and website âœ“
- Scan the code into PDFs
- OCR the code into txt files
- Manually repair the txt into valid program source
- Run the code?
- Understand the code?
- Find/Fix bugs in the code?
- Refactor the code?
- Port it to another language?

As you can see the plan gets a bit fuzzy, but thats OK.  It will surely evolve as I go.

I'm a huge believer in reading code.  What kind of code did Pop-Pop write?
