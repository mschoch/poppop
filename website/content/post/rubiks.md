Next up in the binder is the source code for a [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube) solver.  There is at least one other Rubik's solver in the binder (not counting Revenge) so I'm not entirely sure if they are different versions, complete rewrites or what...

The source code for this is **MUCH** longer (17 pages in total).  The holes were punched right through the still-attached [tractor-feed paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_stationery).  I opted to leave the pages still attached.  This was probably as mistake, it just made the whole scanning process more tedious...

Part 1 of [the PDF can be found here](https://github.com/mschoch/poppop/blob/master/website/static/images/rubiks/rubiks1.pdf).
Part 2 of [the PDF can be found here](https://github.com/mschoch/poppop/blob/master/website/static/images/rubiks/rubiks2.pdf).

I had a lot more time on my hands while scanning this and so I jotted down a few more of my thoughts:

- I'm seeing lots of lines like: ```GOSUB 6240: GOSUB 6290: GOTO 1249``` (it will be fun trying to untangle this)
- How much of this code actually works?
- Will I even be able to understand this?
- There is a *LOT* more to scan, this is going to take a while.
